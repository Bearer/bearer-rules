        title: Missing secure options for cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            The "HttpOnly" attribute when set to "true" protects the cookie value from
            being accessed by client side JavaScript such as reading the "document.cookie"
            values. By enabling this protection, a website that is vulnerable to Cross-Site
            Scripting (XSS) will be able to block malicious scripts from accessing the
            cookie value from JavaScript.

            ## Remediations

            âœ… Set `setHttpOnly` to `true`

            ```java
            cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
            ```
