        title: Weak encryption algorithm (DES) used for password detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            According to [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography/04-Testing_for_Weak_Encryption), DES (Data Encryption Standard) is considered a weak encryption algorithm and therefore shouldn't be used.

            Moreover, since encryption is reversible, it is possible to retrieve the plaintext value. This makes encryption a bad choice for passwords. Instead, passwords should be hashed.

            ## Remediations

            ❌ Do not use encryption for passwords, wherever possible.

            ✅ Use a recommended hashing library such as AES-256-CBC for passwords

            ```java
              Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
            ```
