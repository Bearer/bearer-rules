        title: Missing secure options for cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            The `HttpOnly` attribute when set to `true` protects the cookie value from being accessed by client side JavaScript such as reading the `document.cookie` values. By enabling this protection, a website that is
            vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) will be able to block malicious scripts from accessing the cookie value from JavaScript.

            ## Remediations

            âœ… Set `setHttpOnly` to `true`

            ```java
            cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
            ```
