        title: Missing secure options for cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            To make sure cookies don't open your application up to exploits or unauthorized access, make sure to set security options appropriately.

            ## Remediations

            ✅ Set `secure` to `true` to force cookies to only be sent over HTTPS:

            ```java
            cookie.setSecure(true);
            ```
