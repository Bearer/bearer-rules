        title: Session store with HttpOnly set to false detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            To mitigate against Cross-Site Scripting attacks, we should avoid accessing session cookies using JavaScript.
            By default, Rails avoids this by setting the HttpOnly flag to true on session cookies. Setting this flag to false puts our application at risk of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

            ## Remediations
            ‚ùå Do not disable httponly flag if configuring Rails session_store

            ```
            Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: "some_key", httponly: false
            ```
