        description: |
            ## Description
            JSON is the safest serialization strategy for untrusted data, such as cookie data, to avoid malicious code injection. By default, Rails uses JSON to serialize cookie values.

            ## Remediations
            ❌ Avoid overriding the default cookie serializer

            ```ruby
            Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer = :marshal
            ```

            ❌ Use the hybrid (Marshal and JSON) serializer option as a temporary solution only, for example when migrating from Marshal to JSON.

            ```ruby
            Rails.application.config.action_dispatch.cookies_serializer = :hybrid
            ```
