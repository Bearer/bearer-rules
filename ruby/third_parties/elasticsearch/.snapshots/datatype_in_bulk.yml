        title: Sensitive data sent to Elasticsearch detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            Leaking sensitive data to third-party data tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Elasticsearch.

            ## Remediations
            When sending data to third-party services, ensure all sensitive data is removed.
