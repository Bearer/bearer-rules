        title: Sensitive data sent to Airbrake detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            Leaking sensitive data to third-party loggers is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Airbrake.

            ## Remediations

            When logging errors or events, ensure all sensitive data is removed.
