            ## Description

            A weak hashing library can lead to data breaches and greater security risk.

            ## Remediations
            According to [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography/04-Testing_for_Weak_Encryption), MD5 and its predecessors are considered weak hash algorithms and therefore shouldn't be used.

            ❌ Avoid libraries and algorithms with known weaknesses:

            ```ruby
            Digest::MD5.hexdigest 'weak hash'
            ```

            ✅ Instead, we recommend using bcrypt:

            ```ruby
            BCrypt::Password.create('iLOVEdogs123')
            ```
