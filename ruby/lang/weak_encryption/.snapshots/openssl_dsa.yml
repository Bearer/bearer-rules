        title: Weak encryption library usage detected.

            ## Description

            A weak encryption or hashing library can lead to data breaches and greater security risk. This rule checks for the use of weak encryption and hashing libraries or algorithms.

            ## Remediations
            According to [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography/04-Testing_for_Weak_Encryption): MD5, RC4, DES, Blowfish, SHA1. 1024-bit RSA or DSA, 160-bit ECDSA (elliptic curves), 80/112-bit 2TDEA (two key triple DES) are considered as weak hash/encryption algorithms and therefor shouldn't be used.

            ❌ Avoid libraries and algorithms with known weaknesses:

            ```ruby
            Digest::SHA1.hexdigest 'weak password encryption'
            Crypt::Blowfish.new("weak password encryption")
            RC4.new("weak password encryption")
            OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new 1024
            OpenSSL::PKey::DSA.new 1024
            Digest::MD5.hexdigest 'unsecure string'
            ```

            ✅ Instead, we recommend using bcrypt:

            ```ruby
            BCrypt::Password.create('iLOVEdogs123')
            ```
