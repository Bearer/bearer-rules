            ## Description

            Leaking sensitive data to third parties is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of leaking sensitive data to third parties using google tag manager.

            ❌ Avoid sending sensitive data to third parties:

            ```javascript
            datalayer.push({
              user: {
                email: user.email
              }
            })
            ```

            ✅ If you need to identify a user, ensure to use their unique identifier instead of their personal identifiable information:

            ```javascript
            datalayer.push({
              user: {
                uuid: user.uuid
              }
            })
            ```
