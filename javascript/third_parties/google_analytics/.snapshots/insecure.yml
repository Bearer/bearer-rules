        title: Sensitive data sent to Google Analytic detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Leaking sensitive data to third-party analytics tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Google Analytics.

            ## Remediations

            When sending data to analytics libraries, ensure all sensitive data is removed.

            If you really need to identify users, use unique identifiers from the database.

            ```javascript
              gtag("event", "screen_view", {
                user: {
                  subscribed: true,
                },
              });
            ```
