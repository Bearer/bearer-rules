        title: Sensitive data sent to Rollbar detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Leaking sensitive data to third-party error logging tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Rollbar.

            ## Remediations

            When sending data to logging libraries, ensure all sensitive data is removed.

            If you really need to identify users, use unique identifiers from the database.

            ```javascript
              Rollbar.critical("Connection error from remote Payments API", user.uuid);
            ```
