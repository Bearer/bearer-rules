        title: Missing access restriction to directory listing detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            Inappropriate exposure of a directory listing could give attackers access to sensitive data or source code, either directly or through exploitation of an exposed file structure.

            ## Remediations
            âœ… Restrict access to sensitive directories and files
