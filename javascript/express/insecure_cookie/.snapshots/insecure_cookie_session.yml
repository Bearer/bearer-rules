        title: Missing secure options for cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            To make sure cookies don't open your application up to exploits or unauthorized access, make sure to set security options appropriately.

            ## Remediations
            ✅ Set cookie security values to use HTTP(S) instead of client-side javascript.

            ✅ Set `secure` values to `true` to force cookies to only send over HTTPS.
