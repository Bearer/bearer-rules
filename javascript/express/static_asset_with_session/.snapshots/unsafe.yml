            ## Description
            Static assets are often cached by services in front of the application
            (eg. CDNs). Serving static assets with sessions enabled may lead to
            Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks that can hijack a user's session.

            ## Remediations

            âœ… Ensure static resources are handled prior to session initialization:

            ```javascript
              // static middleware should be added before session middleware
              app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"))

              app.use(session())
            ```
