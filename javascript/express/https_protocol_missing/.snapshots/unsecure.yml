        title: Missing https protocol detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            Use HTTPS wherever possible. HTTPS uses the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol to encrypt communication, making it more secure than HTTP.

            ## Remediations
            âœ… Use the `https` module when calling `createServer()`

            ```javascript
            var https = require('https');
            var express = require('express');
            var app = express();

            var httpsServer = https.createServer(app)
            httpsServer.listen(8080);
            ```
