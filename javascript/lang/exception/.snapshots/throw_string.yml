        title: Sensitive data in a exception message detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Leaking sensitive data to an exception is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to exceptions.

            ## Remediations

            ❌ Avoid using sensitive data in exception messages:

            ```javascript
            throw new CustomError(`Error with ${user.email}`)
            ```

            ✅ If you need to identify a user, ensure to use their unique identifier instead of their personal identifiable information:

            ```javascript
            throw new CustomError(`Error with ${user.uuid}`)
            ```
