        title: Connection with an unsecure HTTP communication detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Applications should only connect to API using HTTPS connections. This rule checks that all HTTP connections use HTTPS.

            ❌ Avoid using unsecured outgoing HTTP communication, especially in the context of API calls:

            ```javascript
            const response = axios.get('http://insecure-api.com')
            ```

            ✅ Ensure to always connect though HTTPS:

            ```javascript
            const response = axios.get('https://secure-api.com')
            ```
