        title: Missing secure options for cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            The "Secure" attribute when set to "true" ensures that a client will only send
            the cookie to the server when HTTPS is being used. This prevents the cookie
            from being observed by unauthorized third parties.

            ## Remediations

            âœ… Set `setSecure` to `true`

            ```java
            cookie.setSecure(true);
            ```
