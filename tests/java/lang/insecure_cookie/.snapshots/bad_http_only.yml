        title: Missing secure options for cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            To make sure cookies don't open your application up to exploits or unauthorized access, make sure to set security options appropriately.

            ## Remediations

            ✅ Set `Secure` to `true` to force cookies to only be sent over HTTPS
            ✅ Set `HttpOnly` to `true` to protect the cookie value from being accessed by client side JavaScript

            ```java
            cookie.setSecure(true);
            cookie.setHttpOnly(true);
            ```
