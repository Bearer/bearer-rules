            ## Description
            Rails uses the same actions for both GET and HEAD requests. When creating
            actions that handle both GET and state altering verbs (eg. POST), the use
            of `request.get?` can lead to unexpected state changes.

            ### Remediations

            ✅ Use separate action logic for GET and POST

            ✅ Check for state altering verbs rather than GET:

            ```ruby
            if request.post?
              alter_state
            end
            ```
