  description: Missing signature verification of JWT
  remediation_message: |
    ## Description

    With JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), signature verification allows us to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the token.
    Not verifying the siguature of JWTs is bad security practice and makes an application vulnerable to token forgery and token replay attacks.

    The `parse()` method does not perform signature verification, and should be avoided in most cases.
    Instead, use the `parseClaimsJets()` method which does perform signature verification.

    ## Remediations

    ❌ Avoid using `parse()` to inspect JWT payloads because this method does not verify the token's signature

    ✅ Prefer `parseClaimsJws()` because this will verify the JWT signature
