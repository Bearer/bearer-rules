    ## Description

    Hard-coded database passwords pose a significant security risk. Embedding passwords directly in your code can lead to unauthorized database access if the codebase is compromised.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** embed database passwords directly in your code. This approach is insecure and makes your database vulnerable to unauthorized access.
      ```java
      Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "admin", "secret");
      ```
    - **Do** use environment variables to store sensitive information such as database passwords. This method keeps credentials out of your codebase and makes them easier to manage securely.
    - **Do** consider implementing a key-management system to securely handle passwords and other sensitive information. This approach provides enhanced security measures for managing and accessing credentials.
