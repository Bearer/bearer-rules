  remediation_message: |
    ## Description

    When creating an SSL socket, it is better security practice to use an SSL Socket factory over `new Socket()`
    This is because `SSLSocketFactory` has built-in support for SSL/TLS protocols and other security features, such as encryption and support for the configuration of hostname verification and trust managers.

    ## Remediations

    ❌ Where possible, avoid creating SSL sockets using java.net.Socket init as there is limited security support

    ✅ Prefer `SSLSocketFactory` methods to create SSL sockets, something like

    ```java
      SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
      SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, host, port, true);
    ```
