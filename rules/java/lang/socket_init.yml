  remediation_message: |-
    ## Description

    Using the naive Socket class to create SSL sockets compromises security. Creating SSL sockets directly with `new Socket()` lacks the advanced security features provided by `SSLSocketFactory`. `SSLSocketFactory` is designed with SSL/TLS protocols in mind, offering encryption, hostname verification, and trust manager configuration. This makes it a more secure option for creating SSL sockets.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use `java.net.Socket` init to directly create SSL sockets, because of its limited security capabilities.
    - **Do** utilize `SSLSocketFactory` to create SSL sockets. This method ensures the use of SSL/TLS protocols and other security enhancements.
    ```java
    SSLSocketFactory sslSocketFactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
    SSLSocket socket = (SSLSocket) sslSocketFactory.createSocket(socket, host, port, true);
    ```
