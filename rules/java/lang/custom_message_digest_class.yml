    ## Description

    Creating your own Digest class is not recommended because manually implement cryptographic functions is a highly error-prone process. It's safer and more secure to rely on standard Digest algorithms like SHA-256 or SHA-512.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** implement a custom Digest class manually. Custom implementations can lead to security vulnerabilities due to incorrect handling or flawed algorithms.
    - **Do** use established Digest algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, or SHA-512/256. These standard algorithms have been thoroughly tested and are widely trusted for their security.
