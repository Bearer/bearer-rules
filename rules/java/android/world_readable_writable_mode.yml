    ## Description

    Creating world-readable and -writeable files poses a serious security risk.
    It is for this reason that the `Context.MODE_WORLD_READABLE` and `Context.MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` constants were deprecated and later removed.

    ## Remediations

    ✅ Use Context.MODE_PRIVATE wherever possible

    ✅ Use a `ContentProvider` when sharing content with other applications

    ❌ (For legacy applications) Do not use the deprecated `MODE_WORLD_READABLE` or `MODE_WORLD_WRITEABLE` constants
