    ## Description

    Sending sensitive data to Google Analytics can result in data leaks. This vulnerability arises when sensitive or confidential information is inadvertently transmitted to Google Analytics, posing a risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** include sensitive information in data payloads sent to Google Analytics. Always review the data being transmitted to ensure it does not contain personal or confidential details.
    - **Do** use data processing techniques to anonymize or remove sensitive data before sending it to Google Analytics. This can include techniques like hashing or tokenization to ensure that any data transmitted cannot be used to identify an individual.
