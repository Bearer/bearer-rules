    ## Description

    The use of a permissive origin in postMessage calls poses a security risk. When you set the target origin to "*" in a postMessage call, it means any website can receive the message, potentially exposing sensitive information to third parties.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use "*" as the target origin in postMessage calls. This approach is insecure as it allows any website to receive the messages.
      ```javascript
      window.postMessage(message, '*'); // unsafe
      ```
    - **Do** specify the exact origin of the target application when using postMessage. This practice ensures that only the intended recipient can read the message.
      ```javascript
      window.postMessage(message, 'https://myapp.example.com');
      ```
