    ## Description

    Exposing a directory listing without restrictions can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or source code. This vulnerability occurs when the file structure of a server or application is made visible to users without proper access control, potentially allowing attackers to exploit the exposed file structure.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do** restrict access to sensitive directories and files to prevent unauthorized access. Implementing access controls ensures that only authorized users can view or interact with specific file directories.
