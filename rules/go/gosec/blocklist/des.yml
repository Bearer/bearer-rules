    ## Description

    The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is an outdated encryption algorithm that is officially considered insecure and is no longer recommended for use. DES was withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2005 because of its 56-bit key size which makes it susceptible to brute-force attacks.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use DES for encrypting data. Its known vulnerabilities and insecurities make it an unsuitable choice for protecting sensitive information.
    - **Do** implement the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key size of 256 bits (AES-256) for encryption. AES-256 is recognized for its strong security properties and is widely accepted as a secure replacement for DES.
