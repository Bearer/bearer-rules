    ## Description

    The `net/http/cgi` package in Go versions before 1.6.3 is vulnerable to the Httpoxy attack. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2016-5386, occurs because of how CGI and FastCGI protocols manage certain environment variables. Attackers can exploit this to intercept and redirect outgoing HTTP requests from the web application.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do** update your Go version to 1.6.3 or later to mitigate this vulnerability.
    - **Do** opt for alternative packages, like the standard `net/http` library, for handling HTTP requests that do not use the CGI protocol.
    - **Do not** use the `net/http/cgi` package if your Go version is older than 1.6.3, as it is vulnerable to the Httpoxy attack.
      ```go
      import "net/http/cgi"
      ```
    - **Do** ensure that environment variables like `HTTP_PROXY` are not unintentionally exposed, as this can be leveraged for Httpoxy attacks.
