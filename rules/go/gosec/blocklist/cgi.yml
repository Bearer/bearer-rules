    ## Description

    Using the `net/http/cgi` package in Go, especially with versions prior to 1.6.3, exposes the application to the Httpoxy attack, a vulnerability identified as CVE-2016-5386. This vulnerability arises from the way CGI and FastCGI protocols handle certain environment variables, which can be manipulated to intercept and redirect outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application.

    ## Remediations

    ✅ Update Go Version

    Ensure you are using a version of Go that is 1.6.3 or later, where this vulnerability is patched.

    ```sh
    # Check Go version and update if necessary
    go version
    # Follow Go's update instructions if your version is < 1.6.3
    ```

    ✅ Use Alternative Packages

    Refrain from using CGI where possible. Utilize alternative packages and methods to handle HTTP requests which do not rely on the CGI protocol.

    ```go
    // Use the standard net/http package instead
    import "net/http"
    ```

    ❌ Don't Use `net/http/cgi` in Older Versions

    Do not use the `net/http/cgi` package if you are operating on Go versions older than 1.6.3 as they are susceptible to the Httpoxy vulnerability.

    ```go
    // This import is vulnerable to Httpoxy in Go < 1.6.3
    import "net/http/cgi"
    ```

    ❌ Avoid Exposing Environment Variables

    Ensure that the environment variables such as `HTTP_PROXY` are not being exposed unintentionally, as this can be leveraged for Httpoxy attacks.
