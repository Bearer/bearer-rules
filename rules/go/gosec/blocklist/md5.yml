  description: "Import of weak hashing library (MD5)"
  remediation_message: |-
    ## Description

    Using a weak hashing library like MD5 increases the risk of data breaches. MD5 is vulnerable to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same output, compromising data integrity and security.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use MD5 for hashing. It is considered a weak hash algorithm and can compromise data security.
    - **Do** use stronger hashing algorithms such as SHA-3 or BLAKE2 for general hashing purposes, such as file integrity checks or generating unique identifiers.
    - **Do** use recommended algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2id for password hashing, as these are designed to be slower and therefore more effective against brute-force attacks.
