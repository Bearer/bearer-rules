    ## Description

    Binding a service to "0.0.0.0" makes it accessible on all network interfaces. This configuration can lead to unintended exposure over insecure or unintended network interfaces, creating potential security risks.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** bind services to "0.0.0.0" without considering the security implications. This default setting can expose your service on all network interfaces, including those that are not secure.
    - **Do** bind your service to a specific IP address or network interface to limit access and enhance security. This can be achieved through various methods:
        - Specify the IP address using an environment variable for flexible and secure configuration.
        - Define the IP address in a configuration file that the application reads at startup.
        - Dynamically identify the appropriate network interface and bind the service to its IP address.
    - **Do** implement security best practices when configuring network services. Use firewalls to control access and encrypt communication with TLS to protect data in transit.
