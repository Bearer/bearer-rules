  remediation_message: |-
    ## Description

    Mounting the root directory (`/`) on an HTTP server exposes a significant security risk. This setup could allow unauthorized individuals to access and browse system files, potentially leading to information disclosure, data breaches, or further system exploitation.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** mount the root directory as the web server's root. Doing so would make the entire filesystem accessible over the web.
    - **Do** serve files from a specific directory designed for public access. Ensure this directory only contains files intended for public viewing.
    - **Do** apply strict permissions to the directory being served. This ensures the server process accesses only the files it's meant to serve.
    - **Do** utilize server configuration files, such as `.htaccess` for Apache HTTP Server, to control access to directories if your server supports it.
    - **Do** consider isolating your server environment using containerization or virtualization techniques. This limits potential damage in case of a security breach by enforcing strict access controls.
    - **Do** conduct regular audits of your filesystem and the files your server is hosting. This helps ensure no sensitive information is accidentally exposed.
