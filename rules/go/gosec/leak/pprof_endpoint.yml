    ## Description

    Go incorporates a native profiling service that can be activated by initiating an HTTP server with the `net/http/pprof` import. The endpoint `/debug/pprof` is devoid of authentication measures, making it accessible to unidentified users. This profiling endpoint can inadvertently expose confidential data and is inadvisable for production use.

    ## Remediations

    âœ… Ensure `net/http/pprof` is import is excluded from your file when deploying to a production environment.
