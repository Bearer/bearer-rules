    ## Description

    Lacking verification of host key during SSH connections compromises the security of your application. Host keys are essential for verifying the server's identity to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, where an attacker could pose as the server. Without this verification, there's no way to ensure the server's authenticity.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use `ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey` as a `HostKeyCallback` function. This method bypasses any form of host validation, making your application vulnerable to attacks.
    - **Do** implement host key verification. For example, use the `knownhosts` package from Go's `x/crypto/ssh` to check server keys against a list of known hosts, similar to OpenSSH's approach.
    - **Do not** disable host key checking in your production code. While it might seem convenient for development or testing environments, it significantly increases the risk of security breaches.
