    ## Description

    TLS versions 1.1 and 1.0 were deprecated by the IETF in June 2018 due to a number of attacks against the vulnerable versions. Use of a deprecated TLS version may result in the unauthorized retrieval of sensitive information.

    ## Remediations

    âœ… It is strongly recommended that all TLS connections use TLS 1.3.

    Go will automatically choose the most secure cipher when negotiating the TLS handshake with client or servers. TLS 1.3 cipher suites are configured to require Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
    PFS is an important property as it will ensure that past encrypted transmissions could not be decrypted if the TLS certificate was compromised.

    ```go
    cert, err := tls.LoadX509KeyPair("server.crt", "server.key")
    if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
    }

    cfg := &tls.Config{Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert}, MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS13}
    srv := &http.Server{
      Addr:         ":8999",
      TLSConfig:    cfg,
      ReadTimeout:  time.Minute,
      WriteTimeout: time.Minute,
    }
    log.Fatal(srv.ListenAndServeTLS("", ""))
    ```
