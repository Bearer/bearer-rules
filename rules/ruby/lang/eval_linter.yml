    ## Description

    The use of the `eval` function, which dynamically executes code represented as strings, poses a significant security risk in any programming environment. This is primarily because it can be exploited to run arbitrary and potentially harmful code, making the application vulnerable to code injection attacks.

    ## Remediations

    To maintain the security integrity of your application:

    ❌ Refrain from using `eval`
    Avoid using the `eval` function as it executes code that can be manipulated by an attacker. Code execution through `eval` can lead to various injection vulnerabilities.

    ✅ Explore safer alternatives to `eval`. Depending on the context, these might include:

    - Parsing and handling data formats (like JSON) using safe libraries.
    - Using functions or libraries specifically designed for the task you're trying to accomplish with `eval`.
    - Implementing functionality directly in the language itself, rather than executing dynamically generated code.

    ✅ Validate and Sanitize Inputs
    If there's an absolute necessity to use a form of dynamic code execution, rigorously validate and sanitize all inputs to reduce the risk of malicious code execution.

    ✅ Use Restricted Execution Environments
    In scenarios where dynamic execution is unavoidable, consider running the code in a sandboxed or restricted environment where the potential impact of malicious actions is minimized.
