  description: "Usage of weak encryption algorithm on a password (DSA)"
  remediation_message: |-
    ## Description

    Using a weak encryption algorithm like DSA for passwords increases the risk of data breaches. Encryption, being reversible, is not suitable for password storage because it allows the original password to be retrieved. Passwords should instead be hashed, an irreversible process that transforms them into a fixed-size string of characters.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use encryption algorithms for password storage. Encryption is not secure enough for this purpose as it allows for the possibility of retrieving the original password.
    - **Do** use strong hashing algorithms such as bcrypt or Argon2id for password storage. These provide a more secure way to handle passwords by making it extremely difficult to reverse the process and obtain the original password.
    ```ruby
    BCrypt::Password.create("password_123")
    ```
    ```ruby
    hasher = Argon2::Password.new()
    hasher.create("password_123")
    ```
