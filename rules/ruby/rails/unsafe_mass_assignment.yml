    ## Description

    Permitting high-risk parameter keys in Rails applications exposes them to mass assignment vulnerabilities.

    In Rails, mass assignment is when we use a hash to assign attributes all at once rather than individually. This feature is often used for creating or updating records.

    When used with an untrusted hash (for example, the `params` hash in a controller), mass assignment is open to attack because any attribute on the record that corresponds to a key in the hash will be automatically assigned the value in the hash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to change their role and permissions or to assign themselves as an admin.

    By default, Rails' strong parameters protect against mass assignment vulnerability. However, the inclusion of sensitive or high-risk keys in the permitted list can still leave the application vulnerable.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** include high-risk parameters such as :admin or :role in the list of permitted keys for mass assignment, to prevent attackers from exploiting these attributes to escalate their privileges.
      ```ruby
      user_params = params.require(:user).permit(:admin, :role) #Â unsafe
      ```
    - **Do not** use mass assignment with an untrusted hash, such as `params`.
      ```ruby
      User.new(params) # unsafe
      ```
