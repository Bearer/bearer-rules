    ## Description

    Storing passwords in plain text within your code, especially for basic authentication, poses a significant security risk. This practice can lead to unauthorized access if the codebase is compromised.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** hard-code passwords directly in your code. This makes your application vulnerable to attacks if the source code is exposed.
    ```ruby
      http_basic_authenticate_with password: "hardcoded_password" # unsafe
    ```
    - **Do** use environment variables to store sensitive information such as passwords. This method keeps credentials out of your codebase and makes them easier to manage securely.
    ```ruby
      http_basic_authenticate_with password: ENV["basic_auth_password"]
    ```
