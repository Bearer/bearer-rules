  remediation_message: |-
    ## Description

    Disabling httponly in your cookie configuration can expose your application to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability occurs when session cookies can be accessed through JavaScript. Rails, by default, protects your application by enabling the HTTP only, which prevents such access. Setting httponly to `false` greatly increases your application's risk of XSS attacks.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** set the httponly flag to false when configuring the Rails session_store.
    - **Do** keep this flag enabled to prevent JavaScript from accessing session cookies and reducing the risk of XSS attacks.
      ```ruby
      Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: "some_key", httponly: true
      ```
