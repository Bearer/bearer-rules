  description: Missing HTTP Only option in cookie configuration
  remediation_message: |
    ## Description
    To mitigate against Cross-Site Scripting attacks, we should avoid accessing session cookies using JavaScript.
    By default, Rails avoids this by setting the HttpOnly flag to true on session cookies. Setting this flag to false puts our application at risk of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

    ## Remediations
    ‚ùå Do not disable httponly flag if configuring Rails session_store

    ```
    Rails.application.config.session_store :cookie_store, key: "some_key", httponly: false
    ```
