    ## Description

    Using unsanitized user input to perform redirects can make your application vulnerable to phishing attacks. This occurs when user input is directly used to determine the destination of a redirect without proper validation or sanitization, allowing attackers to redirect users to malicious sites, potentially compromising their security.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use unsanitized user input when constructing URLs for redirects. Directly incorporating user input without validation can lead to phishing attacks and malicious site redirection.
    - **Do** validate user input by employing a safe list or a mapping strategy for constructing URLs. This ensures that the redirection is to a known, safe location.
    ```ruby
    transport_path = case params[:transport_type]
      when "planes"
        planes_path
      when "trains"
        trains_path
      when "automobiles"
        automobiles_path
      else
        root_path
      end

    redirect_to transport_path
    ```
