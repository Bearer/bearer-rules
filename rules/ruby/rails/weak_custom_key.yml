    ## Description

    Weak model-specific encryption keys can compromise data security. To ensure effective encryption, model-specific encryption keys should be 12 bytes or greater.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use model-specific encryption keys shorter than 12 bytes. Short keys are easier to crack, putting your data at risk.
    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      encrypts :email, key: "weak-key" # unsafe
    end
    ```
    - **Do** ensure your model-specific encryption keys are 12 bytes or longer to maintain strong encryption and protect sensitive data.
    ```ruby
    class User < ApplicationRecord
      encrypts :email, key: "stronger-key-example"
    end
    ```
