    ## Description
    Leaking sensitive data to third-party analytics tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Segment.

    ## Remediations

    When sending data to analytics libraries, ensure all sensitive data is removed.
