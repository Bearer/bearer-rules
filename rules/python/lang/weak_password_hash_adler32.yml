  description: Usage of weak hashing library on a password (Adler-32)
  remediation_message: |-
    ## Description

    Adler-32 is a weak hashing algorithm that offers minimal security. It is not suitable for protecting passwords against intentional modifications.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use Adler-32 for hashing passwords. Its simplicity and speed do not compensate for its lack of protection against data tampering.
      ```python
      myhash = zlib.adler32(user.password) # unsafe
      ```
    - **Do** use stronger hashing algorithms such as SHA-256 to enhance the security of stored passwords.
      ```python
      myhash = hashlib.sha256(user.password).digest()
      ```
