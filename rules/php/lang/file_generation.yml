    ## Description

    It is not uncommon to generate logs, backups, or data exports to static file formats. This rule checks if code exists to write sensitive data to static files.

    ## Remediations

    ‚ùå Avoid code like the following:

    ```php
      foreach ($users as $user) {
        fputcsv($csvFile, [$user['email'], $user['address']]);
      }
    ```

    In instances where writing sensitive data is intentional, make sure to document its location according to your internal policies.
