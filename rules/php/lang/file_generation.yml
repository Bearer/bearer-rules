    ## Description

    Writing sensitive data to static files, such as logs, backups, or data exports, can lead to unintended data exposure. Be vigilant against instances where your code may inadvertently save sensitive information in a format that could be accessed by unauthorized parties.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** write sensitive data directly to static files without considering the security implications. This includes personal user information like emails and addresses.
      ```php
      foreach ($users as $user) {
        fputcsv($csvFile, [$user['email'], $user['address']]); // unsafe
      }
      ```
    - **Do** ensure that if writing sensitive data to files is a requirement, such actions are thoroughly documented. Include the file's location and the rationale for storing sensitive data in this manner, adhering to your organization's internal policies.
