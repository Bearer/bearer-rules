    ## Description

    The use of the 'phpinfo()' function can lead to the leakage of sensitive information. This function outputs a large amount of information about the current state of PHP, including environment variables, server information, and PHP configuration settings, which could be exploited by unauthorized individuals.

    ## Remediations

    - **Do not** use the 'phpinfo()' function in production environments or publicly accessible areas of your application. This function can inadvertently expose critical information that could aid an attacker.
    ```php
    phpinfo(); // unsafe in production
    ```
    - **Do** regularly review your codebase to ensure that calls to 'phpinfo()' are removed before deploying to production. Consider using environment-specific configuration to automatically exclude such calls in production environments.
